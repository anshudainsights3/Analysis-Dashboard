It empowers sales managers, analysts, and decision-makers to track performance trend identify top contributors and optimize strategies for higher profitability.

Tech Stack:The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
1.Power BI Desktop – Main data visualization platform used for report creation.
2.Power Query – Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.
3.DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for calculated measures, KPIs, and conditional logic.
4.Data Modeling – Relationships established among datasets (sales, customers, leads, regions, and products).
5.File Format – .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.

Data Source: Sales dataset (sample business data) from Kaggle.
The dataset includes:
Orders, units sold, and revenue data.
Regional sales distribution (North, South, East, West, Central).
Product categories (Chairs, Desks, Laptops, Monitors, Phones, Printers, Tables).
Customer segmentation (Retail vs Wholesale).
Lead conversion funnel (Qualified Leads → Opportunities → Converted Leads).
Churn rate measurement.

Features / Highlights:
Business Problem-Organizations often struggle to monitor multiple aspects of sales performance such as churn, conversion, and revenue within a single view making it hard to act quickly on insights.
