#  Revenue & Customer Insights Dashboard

##  Project Description
The **Revenue & Customer Insights Dashboard** is an **interactive Power BI dashboard** designed to analyze **sales performance, customer distribution, and lead conversion** across products and regions.  
It helps businesses **drive growth, monitor KPIs**, and make data-driven strategic decisions.
